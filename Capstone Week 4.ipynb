So equipping yourself with a plan that will make a strong foundation for your business cannot be emphasized enough. Making a decision about location, accessibility, affordability, types of cuisines to offer are just a few of the important choices that need to be considered in your plan.\n",
    "Strategy here is look into the most important factors that contribute to the profitability of a restaurant. These include visibility, crime rates, parking size, surrounding business and competitor analysis. This data analysis will be looking at different data that is available such as the crime rate of different locations that will help an aspiring restaurant owner make a decision about the best location to open a restaurant in San Francisco, California. San Francisco is the 13th most populous city in the whole of United States. It is home to ethnically one of the most diverse population in US. It is best known for tourist attraction and business innovation. Walking around in the city it may be evident that the city already has huge number of restaurants.

Next step was to put the each of the incident report into a geological unit, which was achieved by using the neighborhoods data defined by San Francisco Association of Realtors. The data was converted into DataFrame (df_data_5). The incident report DataFrame and neighborhood DataFrame were merged to have the geospatial data on each of the neighborhoods. After having the crime reports on the neighborhoods, focus was on studying these neighborhoods using the Foursquare API. From the API DataFrame including the venue, venue category along with geographical coordinates was constructed. To cluster the neighborhood K-means algorithm was used.\n",

    "After analyzing the clusters it became evident that the most common venues in the neighborhoods are the restaurants, which were consistent with our first impression about San Francisco that indeed the city has many number of different restaurants already. But by checking the crime rate data we can say that opening a restaurant in North Beach might be a good idea due to low crime rate data and also looking at the map, it tells us that it is close to waterfront which means better foot and car traffic, which in turns mean better visibility. Now the purpose of this analysis was only to propose a good location for a future restaurant based on the crime rate of a location, but there are other plethora of factors that also should be considered before zero-in on the exact location."
